  - Whole canned tomatoes:
      notes:

        - amounts: 16
          unit: oz
  - Salt:
  - Black Pepper:
      amounts:
        - amount: 0.5
          unit: tsp

  - Parmasean Cheese:
      amounts:
        - amount: 0.25
          unit: cup
  - Pasta:
      amounts:
        - amount: 1
          units: pound
        - note: Any type of pasta will work with this simple sauce.
steps:
  - step: Bring pot of water, filled with pasta to a boil. Cook until al-dente (usually one minute under box-recommended cooking time).
  - step: In a large bowl, hand crush the tomatoes.
  - step:
      instruction: Heat large skillet on medium heat. Once heated, add olive oil.
      note: Be sure not to let olive oil get too hot (smoking point), as it becomes bitter.
  - step:
      instruction: When olive oil begins to shimmer, add chili flakes, 1/4 tsp black pepper, and crushed garlic. Cook until the garlic just begins to turn a golden brown.
      note: Be careful of burning the garlic, and if it burns - start over.
  - step:
      instruction: Tear basil leaves into smaller pieces.
      notes:
        - Large leaves can be torn into 2-3 pieces, while smaller can either be left whole - or torn as well.
        - Since this is a quick sauce, tearing the leaves helps to enhance the basil's flavor in the sauce.
  - step: Add the crushed tomatoes, remaining 1/4 tsp black pepper, a pinch of salt, and basil to the skillet. Stir, and bring the mixture to a simmer.
  - step:
      instruction: Once the pasta is cooked to al-dente, add pasta and appromixately 1/4 cup of pasta water.
      notes:
        - Reserve additional pasta water incase the sauce appears to be dry, or needs to be further thickened in the next step.
        - The addition of pasta water helps introduce starch, which makes the sauce stick to the pasta better.
  - step: Turn the heat up to high, and stir for approximately one minute. Continue until enough water boils off - and the sauce starts sticking to the pasta.
  - step: Stir in the parmasean cheese and any extra salt if needed. Enjoy!
